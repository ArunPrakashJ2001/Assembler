# Assembler

An assembler is a program that takes basic computer instructions and converts them into a pattern of bits that the computer's processor can use to perform its basic operations.

For example,            
           @10 -----------> 0000000000001010
           
The motivation of this project was to build an assembler in python which reads a set of lines written in assembly language and converts them to a pattern of bits solely using if-else condition checks.
